<p class="introduction">
  In recent months [token simulation](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-token-simulation) transitioned from an experiment to a powerful tool to learn BPMN and its execution semantics. Let us examine how it contributes to the overall [bpmn.io project](https://bpmn.io) vision.

<!-- continue -->

When we incorporated [bpmn.io](https://bpmn.io) in 2014 we focussed on [bpmn-js](https://bpmn.io/toolkit/bpmn-js/), our BPMN viewer and modeling toolkit, initially. We had one vision at that time: BPMN everywhere, for everyone.

Times changed, new toolkits for CMMN, [DMN](http://localhost:9012/toolkit/dmn-js/) and [forms](http://localhost:9012/toolkit/form-js/) joined the bpmn.io family. Regarding our vision, not much changed: We remain commited to make fundamental bits of process communication technology accessible to everyone, everywhere where needed.


## Everywhere, for Everyone

Everywhere, for everyone is where embeddablility and extensibility meet accessibility.

For once, our tools are easily embeddable into any browser-based application. All you need to have is a basic understanding of core web technology. Equipped with that you can transform any website into a fully fledged BPMN or DMN editor. That does not satisfy all use-cases, hence we provide you with [a comprehensive set of examples](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples) how to deeply customize our tools.

Than again, what is a BPMN or DMN editor if it is not _acccessible_? We're talking about [standardized, but complex visual languages](https://www.omg.org/intro/TripleCrown.pdf) that need to be mastered. Our tooling plays an integral role; it shall be friendly and supportive enough, empower, not overwelm you, the user.


## Token Simulation: A Fundamental Learning Tool

[BPMN Token simulation]()

* [Playful learning](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/19/10/power-playful-learning) allows us to gain a deeper.

* PAUSE
* RESUME
* BASIC FLOW
* MESSAG FLOW


## A Core Piece in the Puzzle

* ADDING TO BPMN:IO DEMO


## Outlook

In this post we made the case for [BPMN token simulation](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-token-simulation) as a fundamental BPMN learning tool.

Go to [our demo](https://demo.bpmn.io?e=1) and let these tokens flow.

As always, we rely on your feedback! Reach out to us [via our forum](https://forum.bpmn.io) or [GitHub](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-token-simulation/issues/new/choose) and help us to improve our BPMN tooling, for everyone.
