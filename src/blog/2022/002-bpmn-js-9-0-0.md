<p class="introduction">
  We are exited to anounce the latest release of bpmn-js ships with improved support for collapsed subprocess modeling and viewing. Starting with this release, you are able to use collapsed subprocesses to hide complexity and keep your models clean.
</p>

## Collapsed subprocess Modeling

We gathered feedback on our modeling tools and we heard it clearly: expanding and collapsing subprocesses is not enough to cope with complexity in your Diagrams. With the latest release of bpmn-js, it is now possible to change collapsed subprocesses without the need to expand them - over multiple layers.

After creating a collapsed subprocess, you will now see a drilldown icon. Clicking the Icon will reveal the contents of the subprocess and allow you to model inside. Use the Breadcrumbs in the top to navigate back to a parent process.


## Changes under the hood

bpmn-js is meant to be embedded into your application. There are a few changes you need to be aware of when upgrading from an earlier version of bpmn-js. Most notably, make sure to include the new style sheet `bpmn-js.css`, either from [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/bpmn-js@9.0.1/dist/assets/bpmn-js.css) or from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bpmn-js).

<!-- TODO(marstamm): update link when PR is merged to master -->
The `canvas` API in diagram-js also became a major overhaul and now supports multiple root elements at once. The [deep linking example](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-examples/tree/0eaab013e2e5365b869dce1c15710d3a217933f9/deep-linking) shows you how you can use the new root element APIs.

Check out the full [changelog of bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#900) and [diagram-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/diagram-js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#800) for all breaking changes that may require your action during the upgrade.
