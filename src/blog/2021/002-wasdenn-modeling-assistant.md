## Wrapping Up

In this blog post we showcased WASDENN, a first-of-a-kind intend-based AI-powered modeling assistant that supports you wherever you are on your process journey.

We delibreately chose to ship our first iteration of the WASDENN assistant as a simple in-app character that interacts with you, text-based. For future versions we're actively looking into voice recognition, as that will give you more freedom to interact with the assistant. Look forward to  vocally disagree to WASDENN's proposals or share your excitement, on the voice line.

Give WASDENN a try and let it [improve your BPMN process](https://demo.bpmn.io) today!
